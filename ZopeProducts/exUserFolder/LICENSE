Brief discussion of what the license means to you, not meant to be
all encompassing, but, to give you the general idea. This editorial does
not need to be distributed d8)

If you want to incorporate this product (or parts of it) into a commercial 
product that's fine.

If you want to modify this product that's fine.

If you want to modify and distribute this product that's fine (even in
commercial products).

If you want to incorporate this into a larger work that's fine (even
if that work has a different license).

None of the previous items place any obligation of notification, compensation,
or return of code to us. In fact we don't care if you do these things. Go
forth and prosper. Basically as long as you recognise that this doesn't
belong to you, you can do what you want with it even charge money for it.

Note: If you do distribute this as source, then the XUF components are
removable and distributable independently of your license as a whole
(although that's a lot of trouble to go to when they could just download it
from the same place you did).

What you can't do, is claim it's yours, and this one thing encompasses a lot
of things, here's a few.

If it's not yours you can't;

Change the license even if you change the code since the copyright
of the modified files remains with the original copyright holders.

Use bits of it inside products that require the license to change, because
only the copyright holders have the right to modify the license (not a
concern for commercial projects, only some other Free/Open Source licenses).

Assign the copyright or other IP to any other party of the whole or any
part (even if you change the code), because it's not yours to give away or
sell to a 3rd party.

If the fact you can almost do whatever you want with this code isn't 
liberal enough for you, contact us and we'll see what we can arrange.

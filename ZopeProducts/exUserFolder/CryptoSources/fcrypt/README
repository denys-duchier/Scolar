			      fcrypt.py
			      ---------

This is a pure Python implementation of the Unix DES password crypt
function.  It was ported from C code by Eric Young (eay@mincom.oz.au).
See the file LICENSE for copyright and license details.

This module is packaged with Distutils.  If you have this installed,
or it came with your version of Python, you can install it by typing:

    python setup.py install

If not, you can just copy `fcrypt.py' into a directory on your Python
library path, or into the same directory as the program that wants to
use it.

For more information, see the documentation for Python's built-in
crypt module at:

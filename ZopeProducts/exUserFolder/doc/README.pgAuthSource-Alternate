This alternate pgAuthSource was developed to allow Zope and jakarta-tomcat to 
share common PostGreSQL auth tables. It's really just a mod of the original 
pgAuthSource, with changes to the original kept to a minimum. This should help
when it comes to cross porting improvements / maintenence changes between the 
two versions.

The only thing that's new is the table schema. This auth source uses:
A user table 
	Username, password

A role table:
	rolename

and a associative userrole table for relating the two:
	username, rolename

ps. Use the Source, Luke!
If you dig a little you will find a couple of different ways of crypting 
passwords commented out (plain and MD5).

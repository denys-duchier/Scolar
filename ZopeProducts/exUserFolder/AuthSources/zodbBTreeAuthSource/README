ZODB Authentication Source for exUserFolder

This is an auth source that works pretty much like the standard user folder provided by zope.
It stores the usernames, roles and passwords on a ZODB persistent dictionary. 

It doesn't require any configuration at all, just select it as your auth source and you're
ready to add user accounts.
